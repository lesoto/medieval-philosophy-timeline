He was a canon of Paris; some biographers have thought that he was Bishop of Clermont, because a Bull of Boniface VIII of the year 1296 names as canon of Paris a certain Peter of Croc (Cros), already canon of Clermont; but it is more likely that they are distinct. Peter of Auvergne was in Paris in 1301, and, according to several accounts, was a pupil of Thomas Aquinas. In 1279, while the various nations of the University of Paris were quarrelling about the rectorship, Simon de Brion, papal legate, appointed Peter of Auvergne, to that office; in 1296 he was elected to it.</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="6"><Data ss:Type="String">Auvergne, France</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">45.3548759,3.195472</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">46.211401, 2.20936</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Wikipedia</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="10"/></Row><Row ss:Index="25" ss:Height="23.5584"><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Simon of Faversham</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1260</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1306</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Simon of Faversham (also Simon Favershamensis, Simon de Faverisham, Simon von Faversham, or Simon Anglicus; c.1260–1306) was an English medieval scholastic philosopher and later a university chancellor.
Simon of Faversham was born in Faversham, Kent, and educated at Oxford, receiving a Master of Arts degree. He probably taught in Paris during the 1280s. His philosophical work consists almost entirely of commentaries on Aristotle&apos;s works.[citation needed] He was made Chancellor of Oxford University in January 1304 until his death in 1306.</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="6"><Data ss:Type="String">Faversham, England</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">51.3144088,0.8911894</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">52.84145, -2.30546</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Wikipedia</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="10"/></Row><Row ss:Height="12.1032"><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Henry of Ghent</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1217</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1293</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Henry of Ghent (c. 1217–1293), scholastic philosopher, known as Doctor Solemnis (the Solemn Doctor), also known as Henricus de Gandavo and Henricus Gandavensis, was born in the district of Mude, near Ghent, and died at Tournai (or Paris).

Scotus has had considerable influence on both Catholic and secular thought. The doctrines for which he is best known are the &quot;univocity of being,&quot; that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists; the formal distinction, a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing; and the idea of haecceity, the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual. Scotus also developed a complex argument for the existence of God, and argued for the Immaculate conception of Mary.</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/JohnDunsScotus.jpg</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Duns, Scotland</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">55.7779295,-2.3438852</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">52.84145, -2.30546</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Wikipedia</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="10"/></Row><Row ss:Height="12.1032"><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Radulphus Brito</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1270</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1320</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Radulphus Brito (died 1320) was an influential grammarian, based in Paris.

Radulphus was Master of arts in the University of Paris in 1296, and joined the theology faculty in 1311. Very few of his works are edited, although he was a prolific and apparently influential writer. He was one of a group of grammarians called the modistae or modists who flourished around Paris from about 1260 to 1310, so-called because they wrote on the mode of signifying.</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="6"><Data ss:Type="String">Paris, France</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">48.8565056,2.3521334</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">46.211401, 2.20936</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Wikipedia</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="10"/></Row><Row ss:Height="12.1032"><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">William of Alnwick</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1275</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1333</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">William of Alnwick (c. 1275 – March 1333) was a Franciscan friar and theologian, and bishop of Giovinazzo, who took his name from Alnwick in Northumberland.</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="6"><Data ss:Type="String">Alnwick, England</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">55.4135412,-1.7072797</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">52.84145, -2.30546</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">Wikipedia</Data></Cell><Cell ss:Index="10"/></Row><Row ss:Height="12.1032"><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">William of Ockham</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1285</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="Number">1347</Data>";"<Data ss:Type="String">William of Ockham ( /ˈɒkəm/; also Occam, Hockham, or several other spellings; c. 1288 – c. 1348) was an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher, who is believed to have been born in Ockham, a small village in Surrey.
