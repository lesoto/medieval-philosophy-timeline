He is usually identified as Raoul le Breton, though this is apparently disputed by some. Besides works of grammatical speculation — he was one of the Modistae — he wrote on Aristotle, Boethius and Priscian. Radulphus was Master of arts in the University of Paris in 1296, and joined the theology faculty in 1311. Very few of his works are edited, although he was a prolific and apparently influential writer. He was one of a group of grammarians called the modistae or modists who flourished around Paris from about 1260 to 1310, so-called because they wrote on the mode of signifying.;;Paris, France;48.8565056,2.3521334;46.211401, 2.20936;Wikipedia;2014-02-07 00:00:00.000000;2014-02-23 00:00:00.000000
